Unobtanium Core 0.10.4.1
=====================

Intro
-----
Unobtanium is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, with a fair release and 0 UNO premined and without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run unobtanium-qt.exe.

Unobtanium Core is the original Unobtanium client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Unobtanium transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
